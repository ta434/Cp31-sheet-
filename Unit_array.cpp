/*A. Unit Array
time limit per test1 second

Given an array a
 of length n
, which elements are equal to −1
 and 1
. Let's call the array a
 good if the following conditions are held at the same time:

a1+a2+…+an≥0
;

a1⋅a2⋅…⋅an=1
.
In one operation, you can select an arbitrary element of the array ai
 and change its value to the opposite. In other words, if ai=−1
, you can assign the value to ai:=1
, and if ai=1
, then assign the value to ai:=−1
.

Determine the minimum number of operations you need to perform to make the array a
 good. It can be shown that this is always possible.

Input
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤500
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (1≤n≤100
) — the length of the array a
.

The second line of each test case contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (ai=±1
) — the elements of the array a
.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations that need to be done to make the a
 array good.

Note
In the first test case, we can assign the value a1:=1
. Then a1+a2+a3+a4=1+(−1)+1+(−1)=0≥0
 and a1⋅a2⋅a3⋅a4=1⋅(−1)⋅1⋅(−1)=1
. Thus, we performed 1
 operation.

In the second test case, we can assign a1:=1
. Then a1+a2+a3+a4+a5=1+(−1)+(−1)+1+1=1≥0
 and a1⋅a2⋅a3⋅a4⋅a5=1⋅(−1)⋅(−1)⋅1⋅1=1
. Thus, we performed 1
 operation.

In the third test case, a1+a2+a3+a4=(−1)+1+(−1)+1=0≥0
 and a1⋅a2⋅a3⋅a4=(−1)⋅1⋅(−1)⋅1=1
. Thus, all conditions are already satisfied and no operations are needed.

In the fourth test case, we can assign the values a1:=1,a2:=1,a3:=1
. Then a1+a2+a3=1+1+1=3≥0
 and a1⋅a2⋅a3=1⋅1⋅1=1
. Thus, we performed 3
 operations.*/
